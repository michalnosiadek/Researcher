# Researcher
The primary function of this application is to serve as an innovative product recommendation tool. It leverages the vast wealth of user-generated content on Reddit by searching for posts and comments related to specific items that a user is interested in. The application utilizes sentiment analysis to categorize each comment as positive or negative. It then aggregates these evaluations to generate a positive-to-negative comment ratio for each product. Using this data, the application can identify and recommend the most favorably-reviewed products within a given budget. For example, if a user searches for 'best headphones under $50', the application would return results like 'XXX headphones, with a 90:40 positive comment ratio' indicating a strong endorsement from the Reddit community.
